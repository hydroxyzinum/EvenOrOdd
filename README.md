# EvenOrOdd

This is the war!		
	
The app is converting numbers from decimal format to binary format, then if numbers are even app is counting all '0' from the array and returns the score - it's important becouse this is the weapon! The same thing happens with odd numbers. 
The team - Evens or Odds - who has better score win the game.

E.g.

We have given numbers: [5, 8, 9]

App sorts which numbers are even - [8] and which one are odd - [5, 9].		
Then change these numbers from decimal into binary format:	 [8] is [1000] and [5, 9] are [101, 1001].
Now app is counting, as we can see, zeros from 'even binary number' which equals 3, and then all '1' from 'odd binary numbers' which equals 4.		
So here we are, we've got a score evens 3 - 4 odds. App is analizing the score and in this case returns "Odds win!".

Enjoy and try it yourself! :)
